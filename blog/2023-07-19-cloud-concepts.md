These are my few notes while learning about AWS cloud practitioner, I hope they can help you a little. Thank You.

## Cloud Concepts

**Cloud computing is the practice of using remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data.**

### Difference between On-premises vs Cloud Providers

- On-premises:
You own the server, hire IT personnel and bear all the risks.

- Cloud Providers:
Someone else owns the server, hires personnel, and handles server management while you focus on other aspects.

### Evolution of hosting

- **Dedicated Server**:
 One physical machine dedicated to a single business, suitable for running a single website or application.

- **VPS (Virtual Private Server)**:
Physical machines virtualized into sub-machines, capable of running multiple apps/sites.

- **Shared Hosting**:
One physical machine shared by numerous businesses, cost-effective but offers limited functionality and poor isolation.

- **Cloud Hosting**:
Multiple physical machines acting as one system, providing flexibility, scalability, security, cost-effectiveness, and high configurability.

### What is Amazon & AWS?
